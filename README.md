# Star Wars API explorer

This is a react-native app that uses the wonderful Star Wars API. The intention is to produce an app that allows you to navigate around the data in a variety of ways. 

## Jest
I'm giving up on Jest, [my 'notes' about Jest are here](./jest.md)

## AVA
With a little tweaking we can easily have coverage reports using nyc/istanbul, testing of react (native) components and vanilla JS, full support of async etc.

And we get snaphots now too.
